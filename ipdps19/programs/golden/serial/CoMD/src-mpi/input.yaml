defaultTimeOut: 500 #customize the default timeout threshold

## To inject faults into specific types of instructions:
## (see all posible names in http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html). For include, you can also specify 'all'
compileOption:
    instSelMethod:
      - insttype:
          include:
            - all
    ## To use a location-based register selector to select targeting register:
    regSelMethod: regloc
    ## To select the destination register
    regloc: dstreg

    ## To incorporate the forward slice/backward slice of the selected instructions as injection targets: 
    includeInjectionTrace: 
        - forward # include forward trace of the selected instructions into fault injection targets
        - backward # include forward trace of the selected instructions into fault injection targets

runOption:
    ## To inject a common hardware fault in all injection targets by random:
    - run:
        numOfRuns: 10 # run injection for 5 times
        fi_type: bitflip
        timeOut: 500 # specify a custom timeout threashold for only this experiment
        verbose: True# prints return code summary at end of injection
